Project Title:
AI-Driven Public Transport Route Optimization for Sustainable Cities (SDG 11)

SDG Problem Addressed:
Inefficient urban public transport systems lead to increased travel times, pollution, and limited accessibility. UN SDG 11 seeks to make cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainableâ€”improving transport efficiency is vital for this.

Machine Learning Approach Used:

Unsupervised Learning: KMeans clustering groups bus stops into clusters/zones.

Each cluster can be served by a dedicated route, improving efficiency and reducing redundancy.

Results visualized using interactive Folium maps.

Results:

Bus stops were effectively clustered into 4 distinct regions, based on geographic proximity.

Visual route clusters can be used to redesign or optimize transit routes.

This method scales to larger datasets with real-time GPS or demand data.

Ethical Considerations:

Data Privacy: Real-world deployment must ensure user mobility data is anonymized.

Equity: Optimization should consider underserved communities to avoid deepening transport inequality.

Bias: Ensure algorithms do not exclude low-income or less densely populated areas.
